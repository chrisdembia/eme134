<p>The world contains a variety of vehicles that transport people and goods for
commerce, recreation, and exploration. Vehicles are designed to move through
various environments (land, air, and sea) in efficient, safe, optimal, and
performant manners. The motion of a vehicle is governed by the mechanism in
which forces are applied to the vehicle by the environment. The interaction
forces are a function of the vehicle's design and the travel medium. To
understand these phenomena engineers often turn to mathematical models capable
of predicting the observed motion. Two very common concerns for vehicle
designers are 1) whether a vehicle will ever become unstable and 2) whether it
is reasonably easy to control given the design choices.</p>
<p>In this class, you will explore the dynamics of a number of different types of
vehicles by developing and exercising simple mathematical models. You will also
connect this mathematical exploration to interactive experimental
demonstrations of many of the vehicles. Both will provide insight about the
design of vehicles for good performance and handling. When complete, you will
be able to model vehicles, analyze their behavior, identify common design
issues, and make decisions about design with respect to vehicle dynamics.</p>
<div class="section" id="learning-objectives">

<h2>Time and Location</h2>
<p>The lecture/discussion meets on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from
11:00-11:50 in Olson Hall 250.</p>
<p><strong>If you have any conflicts with the schedule, especially for the exams, you
must tell me in the first week of class (emergencies will be the only

checking his <a class="reference external" href="http://www.moorepants.info/work-calendar.html">work calendar</a> and select a free time between 8:00 AM and 6:30
PM Monday-Friday. Send him an email requesting an appointment at the suggested
meeting times at least a day in advance. You can also email Ehsan and request a
meeting.</p>

<div class="section" id="academic-integrity">
<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Please visit the <a class="reference external" href="http://sja.ucdavis.edu/academic-integrity.html">Academic Integrity
web page</a> from UC Davis
Office of Student Judicial Affairs to review the campus' policy on academic
responsibility and integrity and read the UC Davis <a class="reference external" href="http://sja.ucdavis.edu/cac.html">code of academic conduct</a>.</p>
<p>Feel free to discuss homework assignments and work on them together, but each
student must turn in a <em>unique</em> solution. Keep in mind that actually doing all
of the homework yourself is critical for learning and passing the course.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="textbook">
<h2>Textbook</h2>
<p>We will use the following book as the official and required textbook:</p>
<blockquote>
<em>Vehicle Dynamics, Stability, and Control</em>, Dean Karnopp, 2nd Edition, CRC Press.
ISBN 978-1-4665-6085-7 [<a class="reference external" href="https://www.crcpress.com/Vehicle-Dynamics-Stability-and-Control-Second-Edition/Karnopp/p/book/9781466560857">Book Information</a>]</blockquote>
<p>The first edition of the book, titled &quot;Vehicle Stability&quot; is likely sufficient
but the problem sets will not necessarily match. You will find an errata for
the book on Canvas &quot;Files&quot;. We will also provide you with free online resources
and other supplementary materials.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="assignments-grades">
<h2>Assignments &amp; Grades</h2>
<p>Grades will be available in the <a class="reference external" href="http://canvas.ucdavis.edu">canvas.ucdavis.edu</a> grade book periodically
throughout the course along with class statistics. Check the website on a
regular basis to gauge your performance. Keep in mind that <strong>15% is deducted
per business day late</strong> on all assignments.</p>

<h2>Canvas</h2>
<p>We will make use of Canvas for the course. Log in to <a class="reference external" href="http://canvas.ucdavis.edu">canvas.ucdavis.edu</a> with
your Kerberos ID and passphrase then select <strong>EME 134 001 FQ 2018</strong>.</p>
