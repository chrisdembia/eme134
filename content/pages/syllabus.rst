Course Description
==================

| University of California, Davis
| Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering
| Vehicle Stability - EME 134
| 2018 Fall, Lecture: MWF 11:00-11:50 AM in Olson 250
| CRN: 43393

The world is full of a variety of vehicles that transport people and goods for
commerce, recreation, and exploration. Vehicles are designed to move through
various environments (land, air, and sea) in efficient, safe, optimal, and
performant manners. The motion of a vehicle is governed by the mechanism in
which forces are applied to the vehicle by the environment. Two very common
concerns for vehicle designers are whether a vehicle will ever become unstable
and whether is reasonably easy to control.

In this class, you will explore the dynamics of a number of different types of
vehicles by developing and exercising simple mathematical models. You will also
connect these models to interactive experimental demonstrations of the
predicted behaviors. Both will provide insight about the design of vehicles for
good performance and handling. When complete, you will be able to model
vehicles, analyze their behavior, identify common design issues, and make
decisions about design with respect to vehicle dynamics.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After completing the course students will be able to:

- create simple mathematical models of a variety of vehicles
- identify when vehicles are stable/unstable
- identify parameters that affect stability
- apply simple automatic control to stabilize vehicles

Academic Integrity
==================

Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Please visit the `Academic Integrity
web page <http://sja.ucdavis.edu/academic-integrity.html>`_ from UC Davis
Office of Student Judicial Affairs to review the campus' policy on academic
responsibility and integrity and read the UC Davis `code of academic conduct
<http://sja.ucdavis.edu/cac.html>`_.

Feel free to discuss homework assignments and work on them together, but each
student must turn in a *unique* solution. Keep in mind that actually doing all
of the homework yourself is critical for learning and passing the course.

Textbook
========

We will use the following book as the official and required textbook:

   *Vehicle Dynamics, Stability, and Control*, Dean Karnopp, 2nd Edition, CRC Press.
   ISBN 978-1-4665-6085-7 [`Book Information`_]

The first edition of the book, titled "Vehicle Stability" is likely sufficient.
We will also provide you with free online resources and other supplementary
materials.

Assignments & Grades
====================

Grades will be available in the canvas.ucdavis.edu_ grade book periodically
throughout the course along with class statistics. Check the website on a
regular basis to gauge your performance. Keep in mind that **15% is deducted
per business day late** on all assignments.

==================== =====
Homeworks            10%
Midterm              30%
Final                60%

.. _canvas.ucdavis.edu: http://canvas.ucdavis.edu

Homework
   Weekly homework will be assigned which will be due before class the
   following week.
Midterm
   You will have to complete a one hour in class exam.
Final
   You will have to complete a two hour in class exam.

Canvas
======

We will make use of Canvas for the course. Log in to canvas.ucdavis.edu_ with
your Kerberos ID and passphrase then select **ENG 122 001 FQ 2017**.

We will be using several features in canvas:

Announcements
   This will be my primary communication avenue to you. These announcements
   will be forwarded automatically to your UCD email address. You are expected
   to read these either through your email program or on the Canvas website.
Assignments
   The electronic assignments will be distributed and collected here.
Grades
   Your grades and basic stats on your relative performance will be available
   as the course goes along.
Files
   Copyrighted and private files, documents, and other resources will be
   available here for download. The rest will be available for download on this
   website.

Communications
==============

Email
-----

Personal electronic correspondence from the instructors will be made to your
UCD email address. It is your responsibility to check this regularly.

Electronic announcements from the instructors to the whole class will be made
through Canvas. By default, Canvas will automatically send the announcement to
your UCD email address. You can change your Canvas settings to opt out, send it
them to a different email, or as an SMS. You are responsible for reading the
announcements made via canvas.
